      <p>You charge at him, Dread Pirate Riffers moves swiftly out of the way.</p>
      <p>“You aren’t going to surrender?” he says as he pulls out a sword.</p> 
      <p>“Never!” You charge again, but you trip as he puts his foot out.</p>
      <p>“Are you alright down there?” Riffers asks.</p>
      <p>“Why would you care? I’m trying to kill you!!”</p>
      <p>“I just want you to feel you’re doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.” </p>
      <p>You get up and take a stab at him. You miss. You realize you are no match for him. </p>
      <p>You see your friend out of the corner of your eye. He has a rock in his hand and slowly made his way around Riffers. The other bandits are too focused on the fight to see. </p>
      <p>You charge again, but before you take a shot at him, your friend strikes his head with a rock. Riffers crumples to the ground. </p>
