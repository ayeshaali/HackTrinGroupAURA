    <h2>MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE HIDING BANDITS</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>As you walk to towards the bandits, you notice their regal clothes and the arrogant air about them.</p>
      <p>You feel a whisper near your cheek and a cold blade against your neck</p>
      <p>The man in the front of the group calls out “Who are you? What are you doing here?”</p>
      <p>“Please… please…. I’ve dec… ided to…. join you!” you say in short gasps as the knife pressed harder against your neck.</p>
      <p>Your friend appears behind you. “Please, let my friend go! We only wanted to join you”.</p>
      <p>“Release him,” the man says. “I am Dread Pirate Riffers and the leader of these men. I am feared throughout the land for my ruthlessness and cunning.”</p>  
			<p>Your friend kneels before Riffers. You look down on your friend, angry at his submissiveness. </p>
      <p>Riffers looks at you suspiciously. “Submit to me or die.”</p>
