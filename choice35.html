    <h2>KILL YOUR FRIEND.</h2>
    <div> 
<p>You stab Riffers through the heart.</p> 
<p>Your friend looks on, horrified.</p> 
<p>“Why did you do that? We defeated him!”</p>
<p>“He needed to die. Now we can be the leaders of these bandits”</p>
<p>“But…” You turn away from your friend before he finished.</p> 
<p>“You bandits, I defeated your leader. Either challenge me or submit.”</p>
<p>The bandits look each other meekly and kneel before you.</p>
<p>“Now, to kill the remaining villagers is our goal.”</p>
<p>“Why would kill our friends?”</p>
<p>“We left behind anyway. Now we just need to finish the job, so that can’t go against us!”</p>
