    <h2>LOCK RIFFERS UP.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>You decide not to kill Riffers and lock him up instead, and you take the place of the bandit’s leader. </p>
      <p>You decide to attack the villagers because you don’t want them to come seeking revenge.</p> 
      <p>“You bandits, I defeated your leader. Either challenge me or submit.”</p>
      <p>Finally, the Dread Pirate Riffers is on the floor, at your mercy. He growls in anger.</p>
      <p>Some of the bandits spit at your feet, but most of them agree to your statement.</p>
      <p>“Now, to kill the remaining villagers is our goal.”</p>
      <p>“Why would kill our people?” your friend replies.</p>
      <p>“We left them behind anyway. Now we just need to finish the job, so that can’t go against us!”</p>
