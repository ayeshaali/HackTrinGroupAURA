    <h2>FIGHT WITH YOUR BANDIT COMRADES.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>Having been an average villager with no previous combat training or fighting experience, you march into battle, and immediately take a sword to the gut.</p>
      <p>You fall to your knees, your life blood dripping out of the wound in your chest.</p> 
      <p>You regret everything.</p>
      <p>You wish you had never been involved with the bandits.</p> 
      <p>You die.</p>
      <p>GAME OVER.</p>
