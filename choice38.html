    <h2>TAKE THE BANDITS AND GO TOWARDS THE SEA.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>“We will ride towards the sea now. Take your horses and prepare for battle.”</p>
      <p>The bandits, with you in front, ride full speed, carrying spears and javelins.</p> 
      <p>You see the villagers huddled in the distance, holding their wounded. Easy targets.</p>
      <p>You charge into battle, shouting at the top of your lungs, when you feel a spear at your back.</p>
      <p>You turn around to meet the face of your friend.</p>
      <p>“You...are betraying me?” you ask in shock.</p>
      <p>Your friend replies, tears streaming down his face, “I have to. I have to save the people in my village.”</p>
      <p>This betrayal is not worth your time. “Kill him,” you order the other bandits as you turn to the villagers.</p>
      <p>The massacre is over as quickly as it begins. Wiping the blood of your sword, you smile.</p>
      <p>THE END.</p>
