    <h2>SUBMIT.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>You submit to Riffers and kneel before him. </p>
      <p>You keep your head down, until you hear the Dread Pirate say “Pathetic… ”</p> 
      <p>“You guys are so pathetic. Where is your strength? How can you just kneel there so quietly?”</p>
      <p>The bandit, who had his knife to you neck before, came back behind you.</p>
      <p>You saw his knife press against your friend's neck.</p>
      <p>“Goodbye. I have no need for you.” Riffers said as he turns away.</p>
      <p>You see the bandit slit your friend’s throat. </p>
      <p>You feel warm blood and knife press against your own neck.</p>
      <p>GAME OVER.</p>
