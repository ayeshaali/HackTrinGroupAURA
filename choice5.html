    <h2>REASON WITH YOUR FRIEND.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>“These people are not protectors, they are the ones we need protecting from!” you say. </p>
      <p>Your friend is not convinced. “Can’t you see, <script type="text/javascript">document.write(localStorage.getItem("name"));</script>, there’s nothing left for us here!” </p>
      <p>“And that’s because of these bandits!” you cry frustratedly. “Please, you have to trust me. Don’t you trust me?” </p>
      <p>These words hit your friend. He hesitates visibly, and then his face becomes determined. “Duck,” he mutters. </p>
      <p>As you duck, your friend throws his dagger at the nearest bandit.</p>
      <p>As the bandit howls in pain, you and your friend run towards the stables.<p>
      <p>You both jump on your horses and ride past the bandits, avoiding arrows flying next to you.</p>
      <p>“Where do we go,” your friend asks, out of breath. </p>
      <p>“I saw the villagers running west, towards the sea,” you say. </p>
      <p> After hours of breathless riding, your friend asks to take a break. </p>
