    <h2>TAKE A BREAK.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>“I agree,” you say. “We should take a break now.”</p>
      <p>Relieved, your friend immediately begins setting up his sleeping bag.</p>
      <p>Before long, you are both asleep.</p>
      <p>Fully rested, you and your friend continue your journey anew towards the sea.</p>
      <p>Before long, you can see the shifting waves of the sea.</p>
      <p>“Look!” you point. “I can see all the villagers!”</p>
			<p>You and your friend run towards them in glee. However, you see their disheveled, bloody faces.
			<p>“Townspeople,” you step forward. “The bandits destroyed our homes and plundered our money. We must fight back for our rights and our lands.”</p>
			<p>One villager shouts angrily. “No! We don’t want any more trouble, okay? Our wounded are still hurt.”</p>
    	<p>Several villagers nod seriously.</p>
