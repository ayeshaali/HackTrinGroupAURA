    <h2>KEEP ENCOURAGING THE VILLAGERS TO FIGHT</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>"We have nothing left but to fight," you cry with conviction." </p>
      <p> The villagers are hesitant. </p>
      <p>Some of them decide to stay behind, but the majority agree to fight.</p>
      <p>You arm them with swords and pickaxes and begin the long march back.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, you hear the synchronized hoofbeats of the bandits, sounds that strike fear into everyone's hearts.</p>
      <p>"How did they know we were coming?" you shout in terror.</p>
      <p>Your friend next to you draws his sword. "I'm sorry, <script type="text/javascript">document.write(localStorage.getItem("name"));</script>!, but I had to do this for all our sakes."</p>
      <p>You cannot believe what you are hearing. Your friend has betrayed you. "Why?"</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the hoofbeats stop. The bandits are here. </p>
