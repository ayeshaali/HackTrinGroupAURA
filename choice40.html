    <h2>JOIN THE BANDITS AND FIGHT WITH THEM.</h2>
    <div> 
    <p>You join the bandits, and are given a sword and a helmet to fight with.</p>
  	<p>You become an average bandit, with no aspirations in life. Congratulations.</p>
  	<p>The bandits heard news that the villagers escaped to the sea.</p>
    <p>You march west towards the sea, and prepare for the battle.</p>
    <p>The bandits encounter the villagers a day early, and you march into battle.</p>
