    <h2>TURN EAST TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>You’re running towards the east. </p>
      <p> After a day of traveling, you’ve run out of food, and you become weak from hunger and dehydration.</p>
      <p>From both sides of the road bandits come out.</p>
      <p> You try to fight back, but you’re not strong enough, and the bandits capture you. You pass out.</p>
