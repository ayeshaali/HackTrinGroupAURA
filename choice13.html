    <h2>KEEP GOING</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>I think we should keep going, or else the bandits may catch up.</p>
      <p>Your friend is out of breath, but reluctantly agrees.</p>
      <p>The horses' feet pound on the gravel at a rapid, unrelenting paces.</p>
      <p>Your head hurts and your throat is parched.</p>
      <p>"Thirsty," you whisper, before you fall to the ground and your eyes close.</p>
      <p>GAME OVER.</p>
