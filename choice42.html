    <h2>FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS AND FLEE</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>When your comrades are busy getting ready for battle, you flee into the woods.</p> 
      <p>You hear the screams of you dying bandit comrades as the battle begins.</p> 
      <p>You feel guilt and remorse for abandoning your friends, but you are more glad that you get to live another day.</p>
      <p>Slowing down to a walk, you take a backwards glance at the battle you are leaving behind.</p> 
      <p>Since youâ€™re not looking, you walk into a pitfall trap.</p>
      <p>As you are falling to your death, you think to yourself, what a pathetic way to die.</p>
      <p>GAME OVER.</p>
