    <h2>KILL YOUR FRIEND.</h2>
    <div> 
      <p>You pull your sword out of your friend’s dead body.</p>
      <p>Tears glisten in your eyes as you shout a rallying cry to the villagers.</p> 
      <p>The large number of villagers is no match for the overwhelmed bandits. </p>
      <p>Finally, the Dread Pirate Riffers is on the floor, at your mercy. He growls in anger.</p>
      <p>“Give up, bandit,” you say.</p>
      <p>The pirate does nothing but spit on your face.</p>
      <p>After the deed is done, you fall to the ground, suddenly weary. It was over.</p>
      <p>The villagers huddled together. You stand up, planting your sword on the floor.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go. It’s time to rebuild your village.”</p>
      <p>THE END.</p>
